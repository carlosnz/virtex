Virtex
======

Elixir virtual models. Manage ORM like Models within Elixir. These models have no persistence capabilities built in however they are designed to work with an external mapper module as per the DataMapper pattern described by Martin Fowler. This is essentially an Elixir port of the fantastic work done on the Ruby Virtus library.
