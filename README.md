Virtex
======

Elixir virtual models. Manage Rails like Models within Elixir. These models have no persistence capabilities built in as they are designed to work with an external mapper module as per the DataMapper pattern described by Martin Fowler. This library offers similar functionality the Ruby Virtus library. Differences are introduced to cater for the immutability of data, and to provide mapper protocol aware access functions to facitate the lazy-loading of data in an immutable world. The goal of this project is to provide a component of a functional style DataMapper ORM for Elixir and Dynamo.
