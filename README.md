Virtex
======

Elixir virtual models. Manage Rails like Models within Elixir. These models have no persistence capabilities built in however they are designed to work with an external mapper module as per the DataMapper pattern described by Martin Fowler. This offers similar functionality the Ruby Virtus library. Differences are introduced to cater for the immutability of data. The goal of this project is to provide a model component of a functional style DataMapper ORM for Elixir and Dynamo.
